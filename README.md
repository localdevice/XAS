Upload signed IPAs in the `ipa` folder!<br/>
For OTA Links: `itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=(MANIFEST RAW LINK)`<br/>

## TODO
- [ ] Create a PHP System
- [ ] Make a write-up on IPA Signing (for newbies)

      Disclaimer / Information
      I do not endorse the use of distributing IPAs that haven't been given permission from those that have 
      authored such applications. Furthermore, the intent of this is not for a service such as EonHub, 
      Ignition, or any forenamed piracy-related services. This is rather meant for any developer 
      who wishes to serve their application without the usage of Testflight or the AppStore.

# XAS

A Third-Party AppStore Template (i.e. Ignition, TweakBox, etc.)
IPAs are stored in the `ipa` folder.

For OTA Link: 
itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=(ENTER MANIFEST RAW LINK)

## TODO
- [ ] Create a PHP System Like @Ignition
- [ ] Make a write-up on IPA Signing (for newbies)

## Credits

- [@TryIgnition](https://twitter.com/TryIgnition): Used their .Plist to Create a Manifest (Formatting Was Correct)
